For businesses with existing PBX or VOIP infrastructure, Novia AI Call Center can integrate through SIP trunks or direct connections:

## 1. SIP Trunk

- **How It Works**: Configure your SIP credentials (server, username, password) directly in the dashboard. See our [detailed SIP Integration Guide](/provisioning/sip-trunking/sip-integration) for step-by-step setup instructions.
- **Inbound/Outbound**: AI can pick up inbound calls from your PBX or place outbound calls using your existing number ranges.

## 2. Caller ID Forwarding

- If your PBX already handles call routing, pass the call to Novia AI Call Center only when certain conditions are met (like after IVR selection).

## 3. Hybrid Model

- Some advanced setups keep human agents on your PBX but leverage the AI for high-volume or after-hours calls.
- Example: _During business hours, normal agents handle calls. After hours, calls route to the AI assistant via SIP trunk._

## 4. Things to Note

- SIP sometimes requires opening firewall ports or whitelisting IPs.
- Carrier charges from your PBX provider still apply, plus any Novia AI Call Center usage fees.
