## Appointment Scheduling Issues

### Missing API Key Error

**Problem:** Getting error "missing api_key location_id or calendar_id for GoHighLevel"

**Solution:**
1. Go to [assistant settings](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#default-tools)
2. Navigate to **Appointment Scheduling** section
3. Click **Disconnect** to remove current GoHighLevel connection
4. Click **Connect** again to re-authorize
5. **Select an calendar** from the dropdown
6. **Click Save** to apply the configuration
7. **Verify** the connection shows as active after reconnecting

### Connection Problems

**OAuth Authorization Fails:**
- **Try incognito mode** to resolve authentication conflicts
- **Verify account selection** - ensure you selected the correct GoHighLevel account
- **Check permissions** - confirm you have admin access to the GoHighLevel account

### Calendar Not Appearing

**Calendars don't show in assistant settings:**
- **Refresh connection** by disconnecting and reconnecting
- **Verify calendar setup** in your GoHighLevel account
- **Check account permissions** for calendar access

### Booking Failures

**Appointments not being scheduled:**
- **Email Required:** Ensure the assistant has an email defined in [assistant settings](/ai-assistants/settings/prompt-and-tools#default-tools) and the lead has an email in inbound variables or from conversation. See [Email Requirement for Appointments](/ai-assistants/gohighlevel-scheduling#email-requirement-for-appointments) for detailed setup.
- **Test calendar availability** - verify the calendar has open slots
- **Check time zones** - ensure correct time zone configuration in both systems
- **Review assistant logs** - check call transcripts for booking attempts
- **Verify calendar settings** in GoHighLevel for booking restrictions

### Data Mapping Problems

**Lead data not syncing correctly:**
- **Verify field mapping** in automation platform
- **Check required fields** in GoHighLevel
- **Test with sample data** before live campaigns
