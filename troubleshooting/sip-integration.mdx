This guide helps resolve common SIP integration issues when connecting your SIP provider to Novia AI Call Center.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Test Outbound calls first** - easier to configure
2. **Test Inbound calls second** - after outbound works

## Outbound SIP Issues

### Connection Problems

**SIP trunk not connecting for outbound calls:**

1. **Verify SIP Credentials** - username, password, server details
2. **Phone Type Selection** - check with provider for correct type
3. **Fixed IP Configuration** - usually enable and enter provider's IP address
4. **Provider Settings** - verify codec, transport, port settings

### SIP Registration Issues

**Important:** Novia AI Call Center platform:
- **Does NOT send SIP REGISTER** messages to your provider
- **Does NOT require receiving SIP REGISTER** from your provider
- Uses **direct call authentication** instead

### Testing Outbound

1. Configure SIP trunk settings
2. **Make a direct test call** through platform
3. Check call logs for errors

## Inbound SIP Issues

### Authentication Setup

**For inbound calls:**

1. **Use IP Authentication** - instead of username/password
2. **Whitelist Provider IPs** - add ALL provider IPs in our platform
3. **Provider Configuration - IMPORTANT**
   - **Use our FQDN domain** for routing (NOT the outbound IP)
   - **Send to domain** - ensures correct routing
   - **Do NOT send to IP** - causes routing issues

### Common Inbound Issues

**Calls not reaching assistant:**
- Verify all provider IPs whitelisted
- Ensure provider sends to FQDN domain (not IP)
- Check destination number format

## General Issues

**Network problems:**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify no firewall blocking SIP traffic

**Provider compatibility:**
- Verify provider supports direct calling (no registration)
- Check IP authentication support

## Testing Checklist

### Before Contacting Support

1. **Outbound Test:**
   - [ ] Credentials verified
   - [ ] Phone type selected correctly
   - [ ] Fixed IP enabled with provider's IP address
   - [ ] Direct test call attempted

2. **Inbound Test:**
   - [ ] IP authentication configured
   - [ ] All provider IPs whitelisted in our platform
   - [ ] Provider configured to send to FQDN domain (not direct IP)
   - [ ] Test call from external number

3. **General:**
   - [ ] Network connectivity verified

## FAQ

### Transfer Phone Call Not Working

**Q: Why is the Transfer Phone Call function not working?**

**A:** If call transfers are failing, try these solutions:

1. **Check SIP Transfer Settings:**
   - Set transfer call to "Advanced" mode
   - Use SIP URI format: `sip:number@sip-server`
   - Example: `sip:+1234567890@sip.provider.com:5060`

2. **Verify Provider Support:**
   - Confirm your SIP provider supports SIP REFER
   - Check if transfer functionality is enabled on your account
   - Some providers require specific configuration for transfers

3. **Test Different Formats:**
   - Try with port: `sip:+1234567890@sip-server:5060`
   - Try without port: `sip:+1234567890@sip-server`
   - Try simple format: `sip:+1234567890`

4. **Verify Destination:**
   - Ensure the target number is reachable
   - Test if the number answers calls normally
   - Check if the number is blocked or restricted

5. **Common Issues:**
   - Provider doesn't support SIP REFER
   - Incorrect SIP URI format
   - Network/firewall blocking transfer requests
   - Destination number not answering

**Troubleshooting steps:**
1. Test with a known working number first
2. Try different SIP URI formats
3. Contact your SIP provider to confirm transfer support
4. Check call logs for specific error messages

## Getting Help

**When contacting support, provide:**
- Error messages from call logs
- SIP trunk configuration
- Test results (outbound and inbound)
- Transfer attempt details and SIP URI format used
